# Face_Morphing
Face morphing by recognizing landmarks on face between two images using delaunay triangulation 
Face Morphing program that takes two images as input and generates n frams (specified by user) to perform face morphing 
Using delaunay triangulation. Please ensure that the dimensions of both images in input are same.
"shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" used to detect 68 landmark points on face
